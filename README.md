# BasicCalcByEmu8086
Design basic calculator using Assembly by Emu8086 Calculator.
This research was demanded from my professor for my second year in collage about 8086 microprocessor and about assembly language.
Then using what we learned from our research we were asked to use Emu8086 simulator to design a very basic calculator using assembly language.
The assembly code for the calculator is linked as " calc.asm.pdf", as well as 8086 survey.
you can skip to page 10 in "8086survey.pdf" for a brief discussion on calculator design and its cons.
